title: There may be a bug in an exercise â€” how can I report it?
---

If you see a typo or any other problem with a lesson, whether it be a problem with the instructions or in how the exercise checks your code (SCT), please first check that your code is correct in that lesson's Q&A Forum. If it is correct but not running properly, let us know by contacting us through [Codecademy Buggy Exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises) group.

However before you post a new report to that group, using format outlined by [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51549abe0508c0b97d004add) article, please check that it has not already been reported by going through [this](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51b49a7b8c1ccc4ff6015e47) post and the link to a spreadsheet of all known bugs contained within.
