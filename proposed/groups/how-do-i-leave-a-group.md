title: How do I leave a group?
---

To leave a group, go to the group's **About** tab. Hover your mouse over the **Member (leave?)** button. It will change to say **Leave Group**. Click on that button and the button will change to say **Join Group**. 

That's all there is to it! 

To see all of the groups that you can join you can [Browse Groups](http://www.codecademy.com/groups).
