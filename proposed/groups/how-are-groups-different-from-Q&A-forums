title: How are groups different from Q&A forums?
---

Q&A forums are exercise specific, each exercise section is linked to its own forum. Groups build on this and add even more! In groups the topics go beyond exercises: you can ask advice, show your projects, build projects with others or talk about programming practices. You can find groups based on language, interests, skills, or simply for fun.
