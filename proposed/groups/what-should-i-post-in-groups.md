title: What should I post in a group?
---

This will vary from group to group. You will find that different groups have different purposes which will result in different guidelines about what you should post. You will find these guidelines posted and pinned in each group.

While keeping within your group's guidelines you should post anything that encourages your group! That could mean resources and articles or suggestions and helpful tips. 

In most groups you are encouraged to ask and answer questions about code syntax, things like how, why and best practices.

What you should avoid asking in most groups are questions about not being able to pass a lesson. These belong in the dedicated Q&A forum for each particular lesson.

There is a [set of basic guidelines](http://www.codecademy.com/docs/forum_guidelines) that applies to all groups.

Look for pinned guidelines like these in your group:
