title: How are points calculated?
---
You will earn one point per exercise on Codecademy; if you complete 10 exercises, then you will receive 10 points. The **points today** shows all the points that you've earned so far today, based on your local timezone.

In addition, as you earn points, you will be awarded Exercise Badges, which will show up on the **Achievements** page of your **User Profile**. Presently, they come in eight levels, as shown below.

The "December 29, 2013" will be changed to the actual date you earned the badge.
