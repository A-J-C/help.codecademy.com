title: Where can I find a reference for a programming language's syntax?
---

Glossaries are a listing of commonly used library features of each language. They can serve as a useful guide when studying new languages or a handy reference when trying to remember tricky syntax.

Codecademy has glossaries for the following languages:
 
- [CSS](http://codecademy.com/glossary/css)
- [HTML](http://codecademy.com/glossary/html)
- [JavaScript](http://codecademy.com/glossary/javascript)
- [Python](http://codecademy.com/glossary/python)
- [Ruby](http://codecademy.com/glossary/ruby)

If you ever find anything missing or unclear, the moderators look after this part of the site and would be happy to improve the content. You can bring your suggestions to their attention by starting a discussion in the appropriate group for the language.
