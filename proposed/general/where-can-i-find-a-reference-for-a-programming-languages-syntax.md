title: Where can I find a reference for a programming language's syntax?
---

Every language has its own [API (Application Programming Interface)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) where it defines all its tooling and library features. Glossaries highlight the most common features and syntaxes for a language's API. They can serve as a useful guide when studying new languages or a handy reference when trying to remember tricky syntax.

Here are links to Codecademy glossaries and to each language's API:
 
- [CSS](http://codecademy.com/glossary/css) ([API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference))
- [HTML](http://codecademy.com/glossary/html) ([API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference))
- [JavaScript](http://codecademy.com/glossary/javascript) ([API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Javascript/Reference))
- PHP ([API](http://php.net/docs.php))
- [Python 2](http://codecademy.com/glossary/python) ([API](http://docs.python.org/2/library/))
- [Ruby](http://codecademy.com/glossary/ruby) ([API](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/))
