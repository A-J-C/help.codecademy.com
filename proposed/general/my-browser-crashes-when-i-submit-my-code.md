title: My browser crashes when I submit my code.

It sounds like there is an infinite loop in your code. An infinite loop will run until your browser gives up waiting for it to finish. 

Usually it is just the one tab that is affected. Close or reload that tab and then work on fixing your code before you submit it again. Most likely it is a tiny mistake, look closely at any loops you have included in your program. Don't worry, you aren't hurting anything if you crash again although you will lose any unsaved code. 

If you are having trouble finding the mistake on your own you can get help by visiting your lesson's Q&A Forum.
