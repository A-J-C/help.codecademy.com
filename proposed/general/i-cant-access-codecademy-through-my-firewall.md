title: I can't access Codecademy through my firewall.
---

The network you use at work or school may have a firewall or a proxy in place for security reasons. A side effect of this is that you have limited access to Codecademy. You will be able to visit Codecademy but not everything works properly. You may also run into this if you are using Wi-Fi in places like cafes and libraries. If you find that you have no trouble accessing Codecademy from home but when you are away you find the lessons won't load or submit as expected then this could be the problem.

You may not be able to do anything about this if the problem location is a public Wi-Fi network but you might be able to ask the tech support people at your work or school to see if the firewall settings there are restricting your access to Codecademy. Let your tech team know we use port 80. **Do we need to include domains for the white list? If so what are they?**

It is possible that your own home network has been locked down to improve your network's security. If that is the case, and depending on if this was done by you or is part of your family's parental control settings, this will be something that you or your parents can correct. **something about white list ...?**
