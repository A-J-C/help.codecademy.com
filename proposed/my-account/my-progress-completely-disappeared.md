title: My progress completely disappeared!
---

There are a few possible reasons why your progress may appear to have disappeared. If you are connected to Codecademy with Facebook, Twitter or Google, this may be the reason. If any of these services use another email address than the one you signed up with for Codecademy, Codecademy will automatically create a new account for you â€” and it will appear that your progress has been wiped, but fear not! By logging in with the email address/Facebook account etc. you originally made your Codecademy account with, you should be able to restore all your progress.

If your progress is still not showing then please contact us [here](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/emails/new?custom[labels_new]=contact).
