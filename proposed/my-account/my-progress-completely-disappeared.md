title: My progress completely disappeared!

There are a few possible reasons why your progress may appear to have gone; if you are connected to Codecademy with Facebook, Twitter or Google, this may be the reason. If any of these services use another e-mail address than your Codecademy one, it will create a new account for you â€” and it will look like your progress has been wiped, but fear not logging in with the email address/Facebook account etc. you originally made your Codecademy account with should return all the previous progress you had.

If your progress is still not showing then please contact us [here](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/emails/new?custom[labels_new]=contact).
