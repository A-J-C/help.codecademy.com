title: My progress completely disappeared!

Your progress may appear to have disappeared if you are connected to Codecademy with Facebook, Google, or Twitter. If any of these services use an email address other than the one you signed up with for Codecademy, Codecademy will automatically create a new account for you, and it will appear that your progress has disappeared. In order to restore your progress, sign in with the email address or service with which you originally made your Codecademy account.

If your progress is still not showing then please contact us [here](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/emails/new?custom[labels_new]=contact).
