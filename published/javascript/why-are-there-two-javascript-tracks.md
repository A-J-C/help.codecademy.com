We rewrote some of our tracks to make them more instructive and less buggy. JavaScript (Original) is the old track that we're not maintaining anymore, and JavaScript is the revised track. The exercises in each track are different, and we recommened completing the revised track instead of the old one. To learn more about this change, [check out our blog post](www.codecademy.com/blog/41-new-tracks-web-jquery-and-javascript).
