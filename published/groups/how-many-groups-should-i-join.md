There is no specific number of groups that you should join. 

You will find that some groups are more active than others. Some groups offer coding challenges while other groups are more social. Each can take up varying amounts of your time.

Start off with one or two and see if you feel you can keep up with the pace. You can always join or leave any group with the click of a button.

Joining a group is a great way to learn. To see all of the groups that you can join you can [browse Groups](http://www.codecademy.com/groups).
