title: What should I post in a group?
---

Each group is different, and as a result, they have different discussion rules and purposes. The guidelines for the group you are viewing can be found posted and pinned in its discussion pane.

While keeping within the group's guidelines, you should post anything that encourages the group! That could mean language resources and articles or suggestions and helpful tips. 

In most groups, you are encouraged to ask and answer questions about code syntax, best practices, how to do something, and why something works.

What you should avoid asking in most groups are questions about not being able to pass a lesson. These belong in the respective Q&A forum for that particular lesson.

There is a [set of basic guidelines](http://www.codecademy.com/docs/forum_guidelines) that applies to all groups.

Look for pinned guidelines like these in your group:
