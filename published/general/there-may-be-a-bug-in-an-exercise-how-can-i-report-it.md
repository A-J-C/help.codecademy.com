First of all, thank you for taking the time to help us improve Codecademy by reporting this bug. If you believe there is a problem with the instructions or in how the exercise checks your code with the submission correction test (SCT), please check the lesson's Q&A Forum to see if others are having similar issues. If your submission is correct but not running properly, let us know by contacting us through the [Codecademy Buggy Exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises) group. If you see a typo or formatting issue with the lesson's instructions, we would be happy to hear about that as well.

Before posting a new report to that group, please check that your issue has not already been reported [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmiUmzXzpa1ddGdwRjdHRDlBRkt1eVpBc281a3J3R2c&usp=sharing). If your issue hasn't been reported, please follow [these instructions](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/buggy-exercises/discussions/51549abe0508c0b97d004add) for filing a proper bug report.
