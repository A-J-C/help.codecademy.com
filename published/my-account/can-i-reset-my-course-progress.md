While you can reset your code within individual exercises by pressing the **Reset Code** button, there is no way to reset all of your courses at once.

To reset all of your course progress, the best thing to do is to create a new account. You can [modify your email address](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) and use that to sign up for a new Codecademy account. For example, if your email was zach@example.com, you can modify it to zach+new@example.com, and then sign up for a new Codecademy account using zach+new@example.com. Alternatively, you can delete your account and sign up again with the same email address.
