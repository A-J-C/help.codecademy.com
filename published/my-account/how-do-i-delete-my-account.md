If you can't get into your account, [reset your password](http://www.codecademy.com/secret/new).

To reset all of your course progress, the best thing to do is to create a new account. You can [modify your email address](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) and use that to sign up for a new Codecademy account. For example, if your email was zach@example.com, you can modify it to zach+new@example.com, and then sign up for a new Codecademy account using zach+new@example.com.

To permanently delete your account:

1. Go to **Me** > **Edit account settings**
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Delete Account**, and press **I understand, delete my account**
