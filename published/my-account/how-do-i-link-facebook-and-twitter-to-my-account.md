title: How do I link Facebook and Twitter to my account?
---
To connect profiles:

1. Go to **Me** > **Edit account settings**
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Linked Accounts**, and click the profiles you'd like to connect.

Be careful not to create two accounts — one by email and another by Facebook or Twitter — as there is no way to merge accounts at the moment.
