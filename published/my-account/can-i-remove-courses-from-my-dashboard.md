title: Can I remove courses from my dashboard?
---

It's not possible to remove courses or tracks from your dashboard at this time. While several users have requested this feature, we don't have a timeline for it right now.

If you really want to clean it up, you can [create a new account](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/articles/1394081-how-do-i-delete-my-account-).
